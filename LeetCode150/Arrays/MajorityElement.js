/*
   Majority Element : 
   Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.
   The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

 Input: nums = [3,2,3]
 Output: 3  

 Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
 Output: 2

// This is specific algorithm based question if we wanted to do in linear time and O(1) space but with O(n) space 
// its quite easy just store key of the specific number and increase value ++ every time they accure.
